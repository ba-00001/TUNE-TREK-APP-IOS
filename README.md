# Sprint Planning for TuneTrek iOS App

## Week 1: Sprint 1 - Setup and User Authentication

### Main Features to Develop:
- Initialize the iOS project in Xcode with Swift as the programming language.
- Set up necessary libraries for networking and user authentication (e.g., Alamofire for networking, Firebase for authentication).

### Goals for Sprint 1:
- **Specific:** Set up the iOS project in Xcode and implement user login functionality using Swift and Firebase Authentication.
- **Measurable:** A user can log in using their email and password, with authentication handled by Firebase.
- **Achievable:** Firebase provides easy-to-integrate SDKs for iOS apps, making it a practical choice for user authentication.
- **Relevant:** Secure user authentication is critical for personalizing the app experience.
- **Time-bound:** Complete setup and authentication by the end of Week 1.

### Tasks:
1. Create a new iOS project in Xcode.
2. Integrate Firebase into the project for user authentication.
3. Design and implement the Login / Register Screen using SwiftUI or Storyboards, depending on your preference.
4. Test authentication flow to ensure secure login and registration.

## Week 2: Sprint 2 - Personalized Music Recommendations

### Main Features to Develop:
- Backend or middleware integration for fetching music recommendations based on user preferences.
- Implement UI for displaying music recommendations and handling user ratings.
- Integrate Core Data or a similar persistence framework for storing user preferences and ratings locally.

### Goals for Sprint 2:
- **Specific:** Develop the music recommendation feed and rating system, and integrate it with a backend service for personalized recommendations.
- **Measurable:** Users can rate songs/artists, and the app displays personalized recommendations fetched from a backend service.
- **Achievable:** Start with a simplified version of the recommendation logic that can later be expanded.
- **Relevant:** Personalized music recommendations are key to the app’s value proposition.
- **Time-bound:** Complete the recommendation system and UI by the end of Week 2.

### Tasks:
1. Design and implement the UI for displaying music recommendations using SwiftUI.
2. Create a model for recommendations and ratings, and integrate Core Data for local persistence.
3. Develop or integrate a backend service (this could initially be a mock server or Firebase Firestore) to simulate fetching personalized music recommendations.
4. Implement functionality for users to rate songs and artists, influencing their future recommendations.
5. Ensure the app can fetch and display new recommendations based on user ratings.

### Considerations for Future Sprints:
- Refining the music recommendation algorithm based on more detailed user preferences and listening history.
- Integrating with Apple Music API to access a vast music library and adding features like playing previews of songs.
- Enhancing the app with additional iOS features, such as widgets for quick access to music recommendations or using Core Location for location-based event suggestions.

# Milestone 2 Deliverables Checklist

- [x] Updated readme.md with new features implemented and NEW video with new features
- [x] NEW video with your new features at the top of your old one. Keep your old one!

```swift
PFUser.logInWithUsername(inBackground:username, password:password) {
  (user: PFUser?, error: Error?) -> Void in
  if user != nil {
    // Do stuff after successful login.
  } else {
    // The login failed. Check error to see why.
  }
}
```

###### Fetch Recommendations
```swift
let query = PFQuery(className:"Song")
query.whereKey("genre", containedIn: currentUser.preferences)
query.findObjectsInBackground { (songs: [PFObject]?, error: Error?) -> Void in
  if let error = error {
    // Log details of the failure
    print(error.localizedDescription)
  } else if let songs = songs {
    // Update feed with recommendations
  }
}

```

## Optional: Third-Party Music API Endpoints

When integrating third-party music APIs such as Spotify or Apple Music into an application, developers typically utilize the SDKs provided by these platforms or make direct HTTP requests to their API endpoints. These endpoints enable the retrieval of song data, facilitate music searches, among other functionalities. The documentation provided by these third-party APIs offers detailed information on specific endpoints and the data structures they return, guiding developers in efficiently incorporating music-related features into their applications.

**[BONUS]** For digital wireframes, mockups, and interactive prototypes, tools like Figma, Sketch, or Adobe XD are recommended to bring your app design to life.
